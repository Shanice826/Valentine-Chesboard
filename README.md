# Valentine-Chesboard
This is a valentine-themed chessboard I had made using HTML and CSS by using Grids. I also have a link to my Codepen.io where I originally created the chessboard. The colors I used from a website called Colorhunt.co to help make the colors be more attractive than basic red and pink.

This is my website link to my Codepen.io page.
